Hi, I'm Nathaniel ðŸ‘‹

I'm passionate about complex technical topics ranging from Linux, self-hosting, DevOps, and especially systems administration.

I am currently an undergraduate student at the University of Delaware pursuing a B.S in Computer Science. In my free time I like to turn laps and turn wrenches. 

I am:
- an active contributor to [nixpkgs](https://search.nixos.org/packages)
- an avid selfhoster and digital sovereign
