      <description>&lt;p&gt;The Sephia swap is a often talked about in Miata circles, but documentation for it is scarce. It is my goal with this article to both define the Sephia swap and without getting too intimate, explain how the swap is done. This will not be a guide for swapping a BP in and out of an NA Miata. That has been thoroughly documented by people much more experienced than myself, and would be redundant to cover. I am writing this under the assumption that you know how to turn a wrench. Anything not unique to the Sephia swap will not be covered.
I will simply explain some of the quirks that come with this swap and how I got around them.
Note, this only applies for the 1.8L BP. The 1.6L used in the Sephia is a 8v SOHC turd, and Miata 1.6L&amp;rsquo;s are easy enough to obtain for cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
